    So, in theory, this page would never actually be seen, it would probably be hidden away as an AJAX request target
    URL, that would just delete the token and change the state of the order in the webshop to "cancelled". But the fact
    you're seeing this page means you must have just clicked the simulated "capture" button, and the Netaxept
    transaction was successfully cancelled.

<p>
    You can check the status of the payment in the Netaxept admin interface by looking for order ID
    <?= $payment->getNumber() ?> or transaction ID <?= $payment->getTransactionId() ?>
